#My First Website
I'm new in the world of Technology. This is my first website project and there is still room for improvement. I will keep commiting to update my website to be fully interactive website. 
I made my website with the help of HTML, Bootstrap 5 CDN's and CSS. I have a simple Javascript to create a clickable nav bar, and it is compose of Home,About, Skills, Services, Portfolio and Contact button.
